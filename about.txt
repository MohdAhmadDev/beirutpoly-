# Beirut Poly – A Monopoly Game of the Heart of Lebanon

**Beirut Poly** is a localized, vibrant adaptation of the classic Monopoly board game, redesigned to capture the spirit and soul of Beirut—a city full of history, culture, nightlife, and resilience. Traveling through the neighborhoods of this iconic city, players will buy, sell, and trade properties inspired by Beirut’s most famous districts, landmarks, and hidden gems.

Imagine owning **Hamra Street**, **Gemmayzeh**, the **Downtown Souks**, or the legendary **Raouche Rock**! Instead of railroads, players will acquire famous transportation hubs like **Charles Helou Bus Station** and the **Beirut International Airport**. Utilities are replaced with essential Beirut services like **Electricité du Liban** and the **Beirut Water Authority** (good luck keeping the lights on!).

Chance and Community Chest cards are reimagined to reflect life in Lebanon—unexpected political rallies, traffic jams, or maybe you won a free night out in Mar Mikhael!

**Beirut Poly** blends the nostalgia and strategy of Monopoly with the modern pulse of Beirut. It’s more than a board game—it's a journey through the city that never stops dreaming, even in the face of challenges. Perfect for families, friends, and anyone who loves Lebanon, this game combines fun with cultural pride and a playful nod to the everyday realities of the city.

Will you build the next iconic tower in **Ain El Mreisseh**? Or go bankrupt fighting rent prices in **Verdun**? Roll the dice and find out. **Beirut awaits.**
